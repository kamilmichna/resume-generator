Nancy Reagan gave him an award for his projects. At 16 my father had a stroke and I gave up my dream of playing in the NHL (yeah, right) to manage the family business which I knew nothing about.\n\nThat started a 40 year journey of educating myself through thousands of hours of reading and painful mistakes. But it also turned out to be my life's mission and I wish everyone finds they're purpose and is able to pusue it . I am doing this as a financial educator of young investors after a pretty successful career as the Chief Investment Officer of a nine family investing syndicate; my track record over 30 years doing this is  23% average annual returns.  We invested in: commercial real estate, media IP,  early stage venture capital, private credit, fine art and consumer packaged goods.",
